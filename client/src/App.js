     Router requires a single child which is why we wrap everything else inside an 
     empty div.

     Inside that empty div are any components we want to be rendered on every page
     followed by our Route components.

     <Navbar /> is on the top because we want it rendered above whatever components are
     going to be rendered by the routes. Likewise, we want <Footer/> to be below the
     content the routes load.

     Route components function kind of like if/else statements. If the path is matched
     then it will load the associated component and only the associated component.

     In the last Route (/todo/:id) we are defining a route that can have anything after
     the /todo part. It will store whatever string is after /todo/ in a property called
     `id`. This will be referenced and accessable by the `Details` component.
